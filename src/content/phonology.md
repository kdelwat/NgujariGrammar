**Phonology** is the study of the sounds of a language. In this chapter, the
basic sounds, or **phonemes**, of Ngujari are outlined. These sounds change
depending on their surrounding sounds, a process which will be described.
Finally, the **prosody** of the language will be considered, which incorporates
sound on a level higher than individual phonemes, including stress and
intonation.

# Phonemes

A central idea of phonology is the relationship between phonemes and
**allophones**. A phoneme is **distinctive**, meaning that two words with only
one phoneme changed are considered completely different words. On the other
hand, each phoneme can have multiple allophones, which are the actual sounds
that results in the specific environment they are found in.

## Consonants

Ngujari has a rich **consonantal inventory**, or set of consonant phonemes.
While some of the sounds are common to English, others are not. The following
table shows these consonants. The first symbol in each pair is the phoneme,
expressed in [International Phonetic Alphabet
(IPA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet) notation.
The following symbol, in brackets, is the written representation of that
phoneme. If there is no symbol in brackets, this is the same as the IPA form.

|                     | bilabial | alveolar | post-alveolar | retroflex | palatal | velar  |
|---------------------|----------|----------|---------------|-----------|---------|--------|
| plosive             | p        | t̺ (t)    |               | ʈ̺ (rt)    |         | k, g   |
| nasal               | m        | n̺ (n)    | n̻ (nn)        | ɳ̺ (rn)    |         | ŋ (ng) |
| tap                 |          | ɾ̺ (rr)   |               |           |         |        |
| fricative           |          |          | ʒ (j)         |           |         |        |
| approximate         | w        |          |               | ɻ (r)     | j (y)   |        |
| lateral approximate |          | l̺ (l)    |               | ɭ̺ (rl)    |         |        |

The **retroflex** consonants (*rt, rn, r, rl*) are pronounced with the tongue
curled back in the mouth, just behind the **alveolar ridge**, or the ridge
between the roof of the mouth and the teeth. While the written representation of
some of these requires two characters, it is important to remember that they are
still one sound.

The **coronal** consonants are divided into two types. **Laminal** consonants,
which are indicated by a box under the phonetic representation, are created by
pressing the tongue, just beyond the tip, against the roof of the mouth. The
**apical** consonants, indicated by an open box, are created the same way,
except only the very tip of the tongue is used.

## Vowels

In contrast to the large number of consonants, Ngujari has very few vowels. The
basic vowels are a, i, and u, but all are **contrastive** in their lengthened
form.

|      | front | back  |
|------|-------|-------|
| high | i, iː | u, uː |
| low  | a, aː |       |

When written, the short forms are the same as their IPA representation, while
the long vowels are presented as digraphs, where the short vowel is repeated
twice.

# Phonotactics

**Phonotactics** incorporates phonetic features such as sound changes
(including allophones), permissible phoneme arrangements, and prosody.

## Phonological Constraints

The structure of Ngujari words is simple, with syllables taking the form CV(C):
one consonant is followed by one vowel and an optional consonant (dependant on
permitted consonant clusters). A root word is usually between two and four
syllables long, plus any affixes, which tend to be single-syllable.

### Consonants

The main form of phoneme restriction is found in **consonant clusters**, the
allowable sequences of consonants which appear without being separated by a
vowel. The following combinations are the only allowable clusters:

-   rhotic/liquid + non-retroflex nasal, (*walma*, *garrna*)
-   rhotic/liquid + non-rhotic approximant (*wiilyu*, *parlwa*)
-   nasal + non-rhotic approximant/stop (*bantuu*)
-   approximant + stop (*gaypa*)
-   retroflex + stop (*karlpii*)

In addition, retroflex consonants are never found at the beginning of a word
and approximants are never found at the end of a word.

### Part of Speech

There are some minor phoneme restrictions which depend upon part of speech.

For verbs, as described
in [morphology](https://www.cadelwatson.com/ngujari/content/morphology.html),
the word must fall into one of three classes. This means that they must end in
*rr*, *j*, or *nn*.

Nouns must always end in a vowel, to avoid the creation of illegal consonant
clusters after adding case suffixes.

## Allophonetic Rules

Sound changes apply to the **realisation** of phonemes. While in written form
the phoneme appears the same, in different circumstances it is pronounced as
different allophones.

### Vowels

The *u* phoneme becomes centralised following the bilabial consonants *p*, *m*,
and *w*, meaning the pronunciation migrates towards the center of the mouth.

> happy `pupa` ⇒ *püpa*\
> food `nurtwu` ⇒ *nuʈ̺wü*

The *i* and *a* phonemes are nasalised before alveolar and post-alveolar
nasals, being pronounced with more use of the nose than usual.

> never `wulnni` ⇒ *wül̺n̻ĩ*\
> reed `kanaa` ⇒ *kan̺ãː*

### Consonants

#### Rhotics

The retroflex approximant *r* disappears between identical regular vowels,
forming one lengthened vowel.

> adult `garanya` ⇒ *gaːn̺ja*\

However, if either of the two vowels is lengthened, the approximant remains.

> head `giriirki` ⇒ *giɻiːʈ̺ki*

The retroflex approximant *r* becomes the retroflex plosive *rt* before another
plosive consonant.

> wood `taarirki` ⇒ *taːɻiʈ̺ki*

#### Voicing

The voicing process is relatively new to the language. Voicing occurs when an
unvoiced plosive becomes its voiced equivalent. Recently, plosives are becoming
initially voiced^[The change occurs only if the phoneme is the first in the
word].

In practice, the voiced plosive *g* is the only new voiced consonant
sufficiently formed to be included as an individual phoneme; the rest are in
the process of undergoing the differentiation and are known as allophones.

> to drop `gukarr` ⇒ *gukaɾ̺*\
> tooth `parrnawa` ⇒ *̬p̬aɾn̺awa*\
> dangerous `tuwilwa` ⇒ *t̬uwil̺wa*

The retroflex phoneme *rt* is an exception: as retroflex consonants cannot
begin words, there has been no initial voicing.

## Historical Sound Changes

*Move to dedicated chapter*

Ngujari differs phonologically from Proto-Pama-Nyungan only slightly. The
following is a list of sound changes that have occurred:

-   Apicalised post-alveolar plosive (t̻) becomes voiced post-alveolar
    fricative (ʒ).
-   Apicalised alveolar trill (r̻) becomes apicalised alveolar tap (ɾ̺).
-   Retroflex approximant (ɻ) disappears between identical regular
    vowels, forming one lengthened vowel.
-   Apicalised alveolar lateral approximant (l̻) disappears from the end
    of words.

A major difference occurs in the case of lengthened vowels, which can
differentiate words in all positions, rather than just the first syllable as in
the protolanguage.

## Prosody

**Prosody** is the way phonemes are spoken as a whole, including within words and
sentences. Ngujari has a rich prosodic system incorporating stress, intonation,
and tempo. The purely phonetic aspects of the system are dealt with here, but
intonation and tempo have many pragmatic uses which are left to
the [pragmatics](pragmatics.html) chapter.

### Morae

Every word can be broken into **morae**, which are calculated using syllables.
A syllable containing a short vowel is worth one mora, but those containing
long vowels are worth two. Syllables with one mora are known as **monomoraic**,
while those with two are known as **bimoraic**.

> white `tumwaku` ⇒ 111\
> cloud `rrurtawalu` ⇒ 1111\
> egg `kupaarki` ⇒ 121

The arrangement of mora becomes important when dealing with stress and prosody
as a whole, particularly in the [poetic register](pragmatics.html#poetry).

### Stress

**Stress** is the weight placed on each syllable. A stressed syllable carries
more weight than an unstressed syllable and therefore stands out.

In Ngujari, stress follows an algorithmic process. The **primary stress**^[The
heaviest emphasis] is placed on the second mora of the word. If that mora is
part of the first syllable (i.e. the first syllable has a long vowel and is
bimoraic, the first syllable is stressed. Otherwise, the second is stressed.

**Secondary stress** is then placed on morae at even intervals, appearing on
the syllable with the 4th mora, 6th mora, and so on. However, if two subsequent
syllables would be stressed, the second is skipped.

> seal `bilru` ⇒ *bil̺ɻ*uˈ
> tongue `jaajannalu` ⇒ *ʒaːˈʒan̻aˌl̺u*
> pride `miinaatirra` ⇒ *miːˈn̺aːt̺iɾ̺aˌ*
