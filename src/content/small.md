Alignment
---------

The alignment of Ngujari depends on whether the noun in question is an animate
pronoun or not. For clauses with exclusively animate pronouns, the alignment is
nominative-accusative, but otherwise it is ergative-nominative (i.e. the
transitive patient and intransitive object are marked nominative and the
transitive agent is marked ergative). This system applies only to `wa`
intransitive and transitive verbs. For higher valencies, formed through [valence
modification](#valencemod), the extra arguments are assigned cases semantically.

Verb Phrases
------------

(*)Verb Phrase: vp = aux [neg] np(s) [adv(s)] [val] v

Verb phrases can be as simple as a single avalent verb, such as in “it’s
raining”, or as complex as a tetravalent causative.

In the prototypical verb clause, the following rules govern word order:

1.  The verb’s auxiliary appears at the beginning.

2.  The verb itself appears at the end.

3.  Valence modifiers appear immediately before the verb.

The following examples illustrate basic verb phrases:

(@) wann-uma maaju-maaju-j ka jinn-u-m,
    see.aux-pst kangaroo-pl-nom 2.val.1 eat-an-3rd,
    The kangaroos ate/were eating.

Noun phrases tend to appear in order of importance to the statement as
judged by the speaker.

Noun Phrases
------------

(*)Noun Phrase: np = [adj(s)-attr] n [rel(s)]

A noun phrase consists of one noun, declined by case, and any number of
adjectives and relative clauses. The noun tends to be placed first,
followed by adjectives, although this can be inverted or even mixed
according to pragmatic considerations. However, relative clauses always
succeed the noun and adjectives.

(@) birru-ø birruku miinna,
    sea-ERG blue big,
    vast blue sea

(@) kanaama yirlirna-j gu,
    woven basket-NOM small,
    small woven basket
