The alignment of Ngujari depends on whether the noun in question is an
animate pronoun or not. For clauses with exclusively animate pronouns,
the alignment is nominative-accusative, but otherwise it is
ergative-nominative (i.e. the transitive patient and intransitive object
are marked nominative and the transitive agent is marked ergative). This
system applies only to intransitive and transitive verbs. For higher
valencies, formed through [valencemod], the extra arguments are assigned
cases semantically.

Verb Phrases
------------

[Verb Phrase]:
vp = aux [neg] np(s) [adv(s)] [val] v

Verb phrases can be as simple as a single avalent verb, such as in “it’s
raining”, or as complex as a tetravalent causative.

In the prototypical verb clause, the following rules govern word order:

1.  The verb’s auxiliary appears at the beginning.

2.  The verb itself appears at the end.

3.  Valence modifiers appear immediately before the verb.

The following examples illustrate basic verb phrases:

(Verb Phrase):
wann-uma maaju-maaju-j ka jinn-u-m.
see.aux-pst kangaroo-pl-nom 2.val.1 eat-an-3rd
The kangaroos ate/were eating.

Noun phrases tend to appear in order of importance to the statement as
judged by the speaker.

Noun Phrases
------------

[Noun Phrase]:
np = [adj(s)-attr] n [rel(s)]

A noun phrase consists of one noun, declined by case, and any number of
adjectives and relative clauses. The noun tends to be placed first,
followed by adjectives, although this can be inverted or even mixed
according to pragmatic considerations. However, relative clauses always
succeed the noun and adjectives.

(Noun Phrase):
birru-ø birruku miinna
sea-ERG blue big
vast blue sea

kanaama yirlirna-j gu
woven basket-NOM small
small woven basket
