# Numbers

The number system of Ngujari is built around a dual decimal-quinary system
involving the ten basic numerals which are outlined in the table below.

| numeral | word | numeral | word   |
|---------|------|---------|--------|
| 0       | nart |         |        |
| 1       | naju | 6       | nalwi  |
| 2       | guu  | 7       | puwa   |
| 3       | naa  | 8       | tuja   |
| 4       | jaru | 9       | jawu   |
| 5       | yi   | 10      | najuyi |

Expressing numbers is simple for those under ten: the corresponding numeral is
used. Past ten, the base system begins to see use. Any numeral can be combined
with the words `yi` ("five") or `najuyi` ("ten") to multiply that number. Large
numbers are formed through multiples of five and ten as well as extra numerals,
which follow the multiples. There are two simple ways of expressing any number,
depending on the choice of five or ten as a base, but bases can be combined in
any number of ways.

> twelve\
> *najuyi guu*\
> *guu-yi guu*
>
> twenty-three\
> *guu-najuyi naa*\
> *jaru-yi naa*\
> *najuyi guu-yi naa*
>
> fifty\
> *yi-najuyi*\
> *najuyi-yi*\

When counting, a seperate tally system can optionally be used. "Marks",
or chosen multiples of five or ten, are expressed fully, but numbers in
between are expressed as the difference from the last mark. The
following example shows a speaker using this system:

(@) guu-najuyi naju guu naa jaru yi-yi naju...,
    ,
    twenty, twenty-one, twenty-two, twenty-three, twenty-four, twenty-five, twenty-six...

# Colours

In Ngujari, colours are derived from nouns through the suffix *ku*. There are
six primary colours, detailed in the following table, along with their base
noun.

| colour | word    | noun  | meaning |
|--------|---------|-------|---------|
| black  | nguku   | ngu   | person  |
| white  | tumwaku | tumwa | sand    |
| red    | wirraku | wirra | blood   |
| green  | nurku   | nurli | seaweed |
| yellow | puuki   | puu   | sun     |

Additional colours can be formed either through compounding or modifying a new
noun. All colours can be joined with others to form compounds.

> black `nguku`\
> white `tumwaku`\
> ⇒ grey `nguku-tumwaku`
>
> sunset `kii`\
> ⇒ orange `kiiku`

# Kinship

The kinship system of Ngujari revolves around four *totems*. The population is
split into four:

-   `bilru` (seal)
-   `gunya` (black wallaby)
-   `juunwi` (satin bowerbird)
-   `pilkiya` (platypus)

The pattern of totem inheritance is rigid but simple, with a woman of a specific
totem obliged to partner with a man of another prescribed totem to produce
offspring of an entirely different totem. However, the inheritance is ultimately
cyclic.

| man     | woman   | offspring |
|---------|---------|-----------|
| bilru   | gunya   | pilkiya   |
| gunya   | bilru   | juunwi    |
| juunwi  | pilkiya | gunya     |
| pilkiya | juunwi  | bilru     |

Closely related to the totem system is the `nnurru`, a term for a sacred place
for all those members of a single totem. In contrast, `Yawirrannalu` (sacred
place) is sacred for all Ngujari.

Many kinship terms are relative to totem. shows the heirarchy of relatives
within a totem. Of note is the fact that there are different terms for children,
depending on whether the speaker is themself a child. A selection of kinship
terms that are independent of totem (by necessity of the inheritance pattern) is
presented in the table below:

| word     | relation                    |
|----------|-----------------------------|
| wirrangu | parent, male or female      |
| mulyi    | mother                      |
| wiilyu   | father                      |
| giirki   | offspring, baby (lit. seed) |
