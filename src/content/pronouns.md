Pronouns behave almost exactly like nouns, with one exception: indefinite and
demonstrative pronouns do not decline for case.

# Personal

Personal pronouns differ in three dimensions: person, plural, and gender. All
decline in the same way as regular nouns to indicate case. The following tables
list the pronouns:

|            | singular | dual  | plural |
|------------|----------|-------|--------|
| 1st person | jana     | janna | juu    |
| 2nd person | kurru    | kunii | kurlu  |
| 3rd person | nnarta   | nnaja | nni    |

  : Child Personal Pronouns

|            | singular | dual  | plural |
|------------|----------|-------|--------|
| 1st person | wa       | ja    | waya   |
| 2nd person | ku       | kuna  | kuu    |
| 3rd person | nna      | nnara | nnaa   |

  : Adult Personal Pronouns

|            | singular | dual  | plural |
|------------|----------|-------|--------|
| 3rd person | nnu      | nnuka | nnunnu |

  : Inanimate Personal Pronouns

When speaking of a mobâ€™s elders, a personal pronoun is never used. The elder is
always referred to by their honorific title.

# Possessive

Possessive pronouns are formed through a suffix placed on the relevant personal
pronoun, but only for the child and adult genders. For possession by elders, see
[pronominal possession](syntax.html#pronominal). Inanimate objects
cannot be possessive. For a child, the suffix is *ra* in first and second person
and *raa* in third person. For an adult, the suffix is *lu* for all persons.

# Interrogative

The interrogative pronouns are strongly affected by case, particularly in the
case of location and time. The basic pronouns are detailed in the following
table:

| meaning   | word    |
|-----------|---------|
| where     | kiru    |
| when      | tuu     |
| who, what | pii     |
| how       | piima   |
| why       | wiirtak |
| how many  | kirta   |

  : Interrogative Pronouns

It is interesting to note that "how" is the same as "what" placed in the
instrumental case. The orientative and revertive cases can be applied to `kiru`
("where"), forming `kirurni` ("whither/to where") and `kirunga` ("whence/from
where"), as well as to `tuu` ("when"), forming `tuurni` ("to when") and `tuunga`
("from when").

# Demonstrative

One set of demonstrative pronouns covers both proximal and distal objects.
Distinctions can be made in some cases between both gender and number. The
pronouns are found in the following table:

| meaning          | singular | dual    | plural   |
|------------------|----------|---------|----------|
| there            | naarla   | naarla  | naarla   |
| then             | yaji     | yaji    | yaji     |
| that (animate)   | yanna    | yannara | yannaa   |
| that (inanimate) | yannu    | yannuka | yannunnu |

  : Demonstrative Pronouns

Again, the pronouns `naarla` and `yaji` can assume the orientative and revertive
cases.

# Indefinite

The regular indefinite pronouns are formed through modifying the
interrogative pronouns by appending the correct word, representing
number. These words are listed in the following table:

| number   | word  |
|----------|-------|
| none     | nnayi |
| singular | junga |
| dual     | marri |
| plural   | munaa |
| all      | nnaya |

  : Indefinite Pronouns

For example, "everyone" would be expressed as *pii-nnaya* and "some two
locations" as *kiru-marri*.
