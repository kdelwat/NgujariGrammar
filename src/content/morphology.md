**Morphology** is the study of word forms and the way words are adapted to
different circumstances.

Words in Ngujari begin as stems: individual morphemes^[A **morpheme** is the
smallest possible unit of meaning.] that cannot be used in their base form. A
speaker must add a number of suffixes to the stem to indicate characteristics
such as gender, in the case of nouns, or tense, in the case of verbs. This
process is known as **inflection**.

The fact that stems cannot be used without adding further morphemes makes
Ngujari **polysynthetic**. The language is predominantly **agglutinative**,
meaning that words are inflected through suffixes alone. However, in a handful
of cases words are instead inflected through **clitics**, separate words which
are "attached" to the stem by their relative position in the sentence.

Consider the following sentence:

(@) k-a wa-Ø jari-rn wiirr-u-Ø,
    go.AUX-PST 1s-ERG beach-LOC go-AN-1ST,
    I went to the beach.

The sentence contains three stems: `wiirr` (*to go*), `jari` (*beach*), and `wa`
(*I*). However, these stems cannot be used alone. Each has at least one
additional morpheme.

- `wa` is inflected into the ergative case, through the **null morpheme**^[
  Although it cannot be heard in the spoken language, the null morpheme is
  considered to be a morpheme due to its role in differentiating different word
  forms.], a morpheme which has no sound.
- `jari` is inflected into the locative case, through the suffix *-rn*.
- `wiirr` is inflected into the animate adult gender, through the suffix *-u*,
  and the first person singular, through the null morpheme. It also has an
  auxiliary (discussed later), `k`, which is inflected into the past tense
  through the suffix *-a*.

In this chapter, each class of word will be detailed, along with its inflections
and characteristics.

# Nouns

Nouns in Ngujari refer to concepts which exist regardless of time. Whereas a
verb may specify an action, a noun refers to a concrete or abstract *object*.

Structurally, a noun has a number of important properties. It must assume one
of the four **genders**, which then lead to different verb conjugations. Nouns
themselves must be declined according to **case** and **plurality**.

Nouns can be used as part of a sentence without any supporting morphemes; they
do not require articles or modifiers to assume meaning. Predominantly, nouns are
used as part of a verb phrase. They are distinguished from other word classes by
their ability to assume the role of subject in such verb phrases, whereas
constructions like gerunds cannot.

## Gender

Nominal gender^[**Nominal** means relating to nouns.] is assigned semantically
to nouns, based on their meaning. While the form of a noun itself does not
change based on gender, the class has a number of important effects, including
changing morphosyntactic alignment, possessives selection, and verb
conjugation. These effects are discussed in greater detail later.

Ngujari has a dual-gender system. The major distinction is between the animate
and inanimate genders. The animate gender is assigned to people, animals,
spiritual locations, and many abstract concepts. For example, `Yawirra`, the
concept of the Land, is considered animate, as are parts of the body with a
sacred meaning. The inanimate gender applies to all other nouns. The following
table shows some examples of the distinction.

| animate                            | inanimate           |
|------------------------------------|---------------------|
| boy *wiingurki*                    | teacher *gajangu*   |
| warm-blooded animal *pawkii*       | living leaf *guwa*  |
| seal *niinga*                      | reed *kanaa*        |
| liver *ngunaju*                    | tongue *jaajannalu* |
| breath *gajuwa*                    | food *nurtwu*       |
| bushfire *panwawa*                 | sunset *kii*        |
| a specific sacred site *Narriirna* | rain *rrurta*       |

The animate-inanimate distinction partially determines morphosyntactic
alignment. Consider the following example, in which two animate pronouns are
the subject and object of transitive phrase.

(@) nn-uma jana-j nna-l jinn-arruu-Ø,
    eat.AUX-PST 1s.child-NOM 3s.adult-ACC eat-AN-1ST,
    I (a child) ate it (an animate object).

The two animate pronouns cause the sentence to assume the nominative-accusative
alignment. If instead the object was inanimate, the sentence would decline in
the ergative-nominative alignment:

(@) nn-uma jana-Ø nnu-j jinn-arruu-Ø,
    eat.AUX-PST 1s.child-ERG 3s.inan-NOM eat-AN-1ST,
    I (a child) ate it (an inanimate object).

While this is the primary gender distinction, there is a secondary subdivision.
Within the animate there are three genders used only for referring to humans,
each representing a different stage of life: child, adult, and Elder. These
genders are important in determining pronouns and verbal inflection.

Whereas animate/inanimate is a class defined once for a noun, the
child/adult/Elder gender is mutable, with a person assigned to one of the
genders based on social position.  Those who are yet to undergo the adulthood
ceremony (under the age of roughly fourteen in the case of females and sixteen
in the case of males) are assigned the child gender, while those who have
become Elders of the mob receive the Elder gender. All other ages are grouped
into the adult gender.

The default gender in the stage distinction is adult. All non-human animate
nouns are treated as if they are members of the adult class for purposes of
verbal conjugation.

The following pair of examples demonstrates the role of the stage distinction
in verbal conjugation. The same sentence is conjugated for both a group of
children and a group of adults.

(@) k-aa juu-Ø kiru wiirr-uu-Ø yuurli-mu,
    go.AUX-FUT 1pl.child-ERG where go-CHILD-1ST day-ORI,
    Where will we (a group of children) go tomorrow?

(@) k-aa waya-Ø kiru wiirr-u-Ø yuurli-mu,
    go.AUX-FUT 1pl.adult-ERG where go-ADULT-1ST day-ORI,
    Where will we (a group of adults) go tomorrow?

The stage distinction is also used in declining predicate adjectives.

(@) nnarta-j pupa-tuu,
    3s.child-NOM happy-CHILD,
	The child is happy.

(@) Wiirrutii-j pupa-iiwa,
    Wiirrutii-NOM happy-ELDER,
	Wiirrutii (an elder) is happy.

## Cases

Ngujari has eight nominal cases, with three indicating the morphosyntactic
alignment and five others. Cases are indicated by single-syllable suffixes, as
presented in the following table.

| case         | abbreviation | suffix |
|--------------|--------------|--------|
| ergative     | ERG          | -      |
| nominative   | NOM          | -j     |
| accusative   | ABS          | -l     |
| instrumental | INS          | -ma    |
| comitative   | COM          | -yi    |
| orientative  | ORI          | -rnu   |
| revertive    | REV          | -rna   |
| locative     | LOC          | -rn    |

  : Case Suffixes

For more details on the three alignment cases, see
[Alignment](syntax.html#alignment). The remaining five cases operate as follows:

### Instrumental

The instrumental case (<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">ins</span>) is
used when discussing a *means*, roughly equivalent to the English "by means of"
or "using". For example, when speaking of killing a fish using a spear, a
Ngujari speaker will place "spear" in the instrumental case. The case can only
be used with an *inanimate* noun.

(@) k-a nna-ø tirwa-j baalu-ma naa wuwiirr-u-m,
    find.aux-pst 3s.an-erg route-nom map-ins 2.val.3 find-an-3rd,
    He found the route using the map.

### Comitative

The comitative case (<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">com</span>) is
equivalent to "in the presence of", or "with", and specifies that the noun was
present at the moment spoken of. It often functions slightly differently in the
context of certain verbs. The case is used gramatically in the formation of the
adjectival predicative.

In the following example, the comitative is found in its standard sense.

(@) nn-uuki wiingurki-ø munnanna-rn bunna-yi winn-uu-mi,
    jump.aux-fut boy-erg river-loc twin-com jump-an-3rd,
    The boy, with his friend, will jump over the river.

Special meanings of the comitative arise when the verb has a dedicated
comitative valence slot.

(@) j-a nnaa-ø parnti-j mungu-yi yanj-u-m,
    steal.aux-pst 3pl.an-erg kangaroo.meat-nom woman-com steal-an-3rd,
    They are stealing kangaroo meat from the woman.

### Locative

The locative case (<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">loc</span>) is used to
specify a location, and can take the place of a preposition such as "in" or
"at". Many verbs of motion take the locative as one of their prescribed
arguments.

(@) k-aa wa-ø gaypa-rn wiirr-u-ø,
    ↗go.aux-fut 1s-erg mountain-loc go-an-1st,
    Should I go to the mountain?

### Orientative and Revertive

The orientative case (<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">ori</span>) is used
to specify that something is facing towards the noun. It is often used with the
meaning of "heading towards".

(@) j-i ku-ø tinyu-rnu yaj-u-n,
    run.aux-pres 2s-erg camp-ori run-an-2nd,
    You are running towards the camp.

The revertive case (<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">rev</span>)
is used to specify that something is oriented away from the noun. It can
be used with the meaning of "heading away from".

(@) k-i nnaa-j mulu-l ja-rna mirr-u-m,
    bring.aux-pres 3pl.an-nom fish-acc 1d-rev bring-an-3rd,
    They are bringing the fish away from us two.

It can also be used in asserting falsehood.

(@) j-arlu nna-ø pirraa-j naa baj-u-m,
    look.aux-rem 3s.an-erg knowledge-nom 1.val.2 look-an-3rd,
    He used to look away from knowledge / he used to be incorrect.

Both the orientative and revertive case can be used in place of the locative
place in any verbal argument slot that requires a locative, allowing for finer
control.

An example of the use of these cases is found in the following table, which
shows the declensions of the noun `naju`.

| case         | word    | meaning                         |
|--------------|---------|---------------------------------|
| ergative     | naju    | -                               |
| nominative   | najuj   | -                               |
| accusative   | najul   | -                               |
| instrumental | najuma  | "using the rock"                |
| comitative   | najuyi  | "in the presence of the rock"   |
| orientative  | najurnu | "oriented towards the rock"     |
| revertive    | najurna | "orientated away from the rock" |
| locative     | najurn  | "at the rock"                   |

## Plurality

Plurality refers to the number of a noun present. A singular noun has only one
of its kind present, while a plural noun has multiple. The Ngujari language
distinguishes between singular, plural, and dual (two objects). By default, nouns are singular.

Plurals are formed through the process of reduplication^[Repeating a part or
whole of a word], with the undeclined noun repeated twice. The necessary case
suffixes are then applied to the end of the reduplicated form.

The process differs slightly depending on whether there is dual or non-dual
plurality. For non-dual, the entirety of the noun is simply reduplicated. The
same occurs for the dual, but the clitic *ka* follows the reduplicated noun
before any adjectives.

Some examples of regular plurals can be found in the following table.

| meaning | singular | plural          | dual               |
|---------|----------|-----------------|--------------------|
| path    | wumpa    | wumpa-wumpa     | wumpa-wumpa-ka     |
| canoe   | turrayi  | turrayi-turrayi | turrayi-turrayi-ka |
| berry   | murta    | murta-murta     | murta-murta-ka     |
| dingo   | nnalji   | nnalji-nnalji   | nnalji-nnalji-ka   |

While the process of plural formation is usually regular, some animate nouns
have irregular plural forms, as below.

| meaning      | singular     | plural       | dual            |
|--------------|--------------|--------------|-----------------|
| woman        | mungu        | mungungu     | mungungu-ka     |
| man          | wiingu       | wiingungu    | niingungu-ka    |
| girl         | mungurki     | mungurgu     | mungurguki      |
| boy          | wiingurki    | wiingurgu    | wiingurguki     |
| elder        | nguwa        | nguwii       | nguwii-ka       |
| sacred place | Yawirrannalu | Yawirrannala | Yawirrannala-ka |

In addition, some nouns are inherently both singular and plural and do not adopt
a special plural form. A handful of examples follows.

| meaning    | word       |
|------------|------------|
| food       | nurtwu     |
| flesh      | ngunna     |
| blood      | wirra      |
| rain cloud | rrurtawalu |
| leaf       | nnaawi     |

There is no distinction between count nouns, which can be specifically counted,
and mass nouns, which cannot. The number of the noun present can be specified
through the usual adjective system.

> rock `naju`\
> ⇒ five rocks `yi naju`\
> ⇒ a handful of rocks `ayi naju`


## Proper nouns

Proper nouns are the names of specific objects, usually people. They are most
commonly found referring to members of the speaker's mob or extended
relationship network. However, many spiritual concepts in the Dreamtime are
referred to by proper nouns, which are capitalised for clarity.

Proper nouns are structurally identical to regular nouns, except that they lack
the restriction on their final syllable and can end in a consonant. In this
instance, the usual suffixes are added to signify case after reduplicating the
final vowel in the noun.

(@) k-a girlipuu-girlipuu-ø Yurluj-urn naa yarr-a-m,
    fall.aux-pst mango-pl-erg Yurluj-loc 1.val.2 fall-inan-3rd,
    The mangoes fell on Yurluj.

However, proper nouns are unique in that they do not always require inflection
for grammatical case. Speakers will only decline proper nouns if the sentence
would be otherwise ambiguous. In the following sentence, it is obvious that the
proper noun takes the nominative position and it is not inflected.

(@) j-aa munna-ø Parra naju-rna nakij-a-m,
    move.aux-fut stream-erg Parra-nom rock-rev move-inan-3rd,
    The stream will take Parra away from the rock.

The need to distinguish proper nouns using case inflections usually arises when
two proper nouns are in the same sentence.

(@) nn-i-yii Annurra-ø Najii-j yiinn-u-mi,
    help.aux-pres-wimp Annurra-erg Najii-nom help-an-3rd,
    Annurra should help Najii.

Even in circumstances where the meaning of the sentence would be unambiguous
without case inflection, the speaker may choose to inflect if they are using a
non-standard word order.

# Verbs

Verbs in Ngujari are found in three classes, each with a specified stem ending.
Verb roots lack a final consonant, meaning they must be conjugated in order to
appear in speech. Class does not have any semantic impact; it changes only the
morphology of the verb. The three classes are outlined below.

| class  | ending | auxiliary | negative particle |
|--------|--------|-----------|-------------------|
| first  | -rr    | k-        | tu                |
| second | -j     | j-        | ti                |
| third  | -nn    | nn-       | wuu               |

In addition to its root, a verb is almost always accompanied by an *auxiliary*,
which is a seperate word mandated by the verb's class. To conjugate a verb, both
it and its auxiliary must be declined. The verb itself is conjugated in
agreement with the gender and person of its subject, while the auxiliary is
declined to indicate tense and *optionally* mood. All declensions are realised
as agglutinative suffixes. The first two medals present the suffixes for the
verb root, with gender specified before person, while the next two outline the
suffixes for the auxiliary, with tense specified before mood.

| class  | child | adult | elder | inanimate |
|--------|-------|-------|-------|-----------|
| first  | uu    | u     | iiwa  | a         |
| second | awuu  | awu   | iwa   | a         |
| third  | arruu | u     | iwu   | aa        |

  : Gender of Subject

| class         | 1st | 2nd | 3rd |
|---------------|-----|-----|-----|
| first, second | -   | n   | m   |
| third         | -   | ku  | mi  |

  : Person of Subject

| class  | remote past | past | present | future |
|--------|-------------|------|---------|--------|
| first  | arlu        | a    | i       | aa     |
| second | arlu        | a    | i       | aa     |
| third  | una         | uma  | uu      | uuki   |

  : Tense

| class  | subjunctive | weak imperative | strong imperative | gnomic | dubitative |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------------------|--------|------------|
| first  | tiru        | yii             | ju                | nga    | tila       |
| second | tirlu       | yii             | yuu               | nga    | ti         |
| third  | tiru        | yii             | ju                | nga    | ti         |

  : Mood

## Irregular Auxiliaries

There are seven major verbs in Ngujari which have an irregular
auxiliary. Each auxiliary is a modified form of the base verb and must
be learned seperately. Conjugation follows the verb's class and proceeds
as normal.

- `ngurr`: ngarr
- `gulwaj`: gulw
- `gurr`: garr
- `nnurr`: nnarr
- `wann`: wunn
- `yurr`: yirr
- `girr`: gurr

## Tense and Mood

There are four tenses: remote past, past, present, and future. There is no
distinction drawn between the perfective and imperfective aspects, meaning
contextual clues are vital for understanding.

Present is considered the default tense. It usually indicates those events which
are happening in the moment of utterance, but it can also be used as a
rudimentary form of a near-past tense, applying to actions that were completed
the same day as the utterance.

(@) j-i rrurtawalu-ø yuu-waya-rnu purki yaj-u-ø,
    come.aux-pres rain.cloud-erg int-1pl-ori come-an-1st,
    Are the rain clouds drawing near?

(@) gulw-i wa-j nnu-yi nna-l gulwaj-u-ø,
    give.aux-pres 1s-nom 3s.inan-com 3s.an-acc give-an-1st,
    I gave it to him earlier today.

The past tense simply refers to an event that began and concluded in the past.
If the event has not yet concluded, the present tense is used, even if it began
in the past.

(@) k-a waya-ø maaju-j bilj-u-m nna-j pirr-u-ø,
    see.aux-pst 1pl-erg kangaroo-nom hop-an-3rd 3s.an-nom see-an-1st,
    We saw the hopping kangaroo.

The remote past also indicates an event that was completed in the past.
Choice between it and the standard past can be somewhat arbitrary, but
in general remote past is used in the following three circumstances:

-   recounting handed-down stories
-   speaking of ancestral events
-   referring to a habitual action that has concluded

(@) nn-una puu-ø Bilru-rn pupa-pu bunn-u-mi,
    shine.aux-rem sun-erg bilru-loc happy-an shine-an-3rd,
    The sun shone down on Bilru, who was happy.

(@) ngarr-arlu walma-ø gaypa-wa-rn ngurr-a-m,
    be.aux-rem hut-erg mounain-loc be-inan-3rd,
    The hut used to be on the hill.

Future is again marked for all classes. All events which are yet to take
place are assigned the future tense.

(@) k-aa tu wa-ø naarla wiirr-u-ø,
    go.aux-fut neg 1s-erg there go-an-1st,
    I won't go there.

There are five moods that a verb can optionally be conjugated for:

-   subjunctive
-   weak imperative
-   strong imperative
-   gnomic
-   dubitative

subjunctive

:   The subjunctive mood is an irrealis mood which broadly signifies
    abstractness and is used in a number of ways:

    1.  Speculation
    2.  Conditional
    3.  Desires
    4.  Purposive

imperative

:   The imperative mood is used for suggestions and commands. The weak
    form raises an idea without indicated an order, similar to the
    English "let's go", whereas the strong form signifies a command,
    such as "Leave!".

gnomic

:   The gnomic mood states unequivocal facts or ideas. The statement
    must be truly uncontentious to fit into the gnomic mood, such as
    "fire is real".

dubitative

:   The dubitative mood indicates situational possibility, in that the
    speaker acknowledges the possibility of an action but is unsure as
    to whether it occurs, as in English "might".

## Verbal Arguments

Arguments to verbs must fit two criteria: number and case. A verb takes a number
of arguments equal to its valence, which can be modified. Each form of the verb
specifies the case of its arguments. The majority of verbs with valence two take
a subject and an object in the correct alignment.

However, this can differ, especially in the case of verbs relevant to movement
which may take a subject and a location. In the case of verbs requiring an
argument in the locative case, the argument may instead be placed in the
revertive or orientative case for further control over meaning.

### Valence Modification

The verbal system of Ngujari allows for many different valences through
derivations of base verbs. Each verb root has its own *default valence*, between
avalent (0 arguments) to quadrivalent (4 arguments). Furthermore, each verb has
a *minimum valence* and *maximum valence*, i.e. the extent that valency can be
modified while still modifying the verb's meaning, rather than imparting
additional information. The maximum valence is never above 4.

For example, the verb `wurr` has a default valence of 0, in which case it means
"it is electrically storming". However, modifying its valence to 1 allows it to
mean "to be struck by lightning", and a valence of 2 allows it to mean "to
strike". Therefore, it has a minimum valence of 0 and maximum valence of 2.

Valence modification occurs through special particles, which are found in the
following table:

|   | 0     | 1     | 2   | 3     | 4     |
|---|-------|-------|-----|-------|-------|
| 0 | -     | wi    | ji  | murnu | yurnu |
| 1 | wi    | -     | naa | naki  | mu    |
| 2 | waa   | ka    | -   | naa   | naki  |
| 3 | wangu | waa   | ka  | -     | naa   |
| 4 | wirru | wangu | waa | ka    | -     |

  : Valence Modifiers (target valence along the top, default along the left)

The main functions of derived valences are to either change the root meaning of
the verb or modify its arguments. In both cases, the new meaning and arguments
must be learned.

### Common Verb Valences

For each of the seven verbs with irregular auxiliaries, the different possible
valences and accordingly arguments are shown below. The default valence appears
in bold. The argument markers *SUBJ* and *OBJ* refer to the subject and object
respectively, which differs according to alignment.

- `ngurr`: **(2) SUBJ is OBJ**
- `gulwaj`: (2) SUBJ gives to OBJ; **(3) SUBJ gives COM to OBJ**
- `gurr`: (2) SUBJ has OBJ; **(3) SUBJ has OBJ in COM manner**[^1]
- `nnurr`: **(2) SENTENCE causes SENTENCE**[^2]
- `wann`: **(1) SUBJ knows**; (2) SUBJ knows OBJ; (3) SUBJ knows OBJ because of INST
- `yurr`: **(1) SUBJ knows**; (2) SUBJ knows OBJ; (3) SUBJ knows OBJ on the authority of COM
- `girr`: **(1) SUBJ senses something**; (2) SUBJ feels that SENTENCE[^3]

# Adjectives and Adverbs

Adjectives are inflected into two categories: attribute and predicate. The
attributive form is unmarked, and can be used directly in noun phrases to
describe the noun. The predicate form can only be used in predicative phrases,
and is declined according to the gender of the noun it applies to.

To decline a predicate adjective, two steps are required:

1.  If the adjective ends in a vowel, its last consonant is added to the end.
    Otherwise, it is unmodified.
2.  The relevant gender suffix of a class one verb is added as a suffix.

Adverbs are not declined, but are divided semantically into the classes manner
(hastily, carefully) and temporal (last week, yesterday). The class of an adverb
loosely determines its position in a phrase.

[^1]: For an example of the use of the comitative slot, see the
    constituent negative in the syntax chapter.

[^2]: The verb `nnurr` is a special case. See the [subjunctive](syntax.html#subjunctive).

[^3]: Where the sentence is in the subjunctive mood.
